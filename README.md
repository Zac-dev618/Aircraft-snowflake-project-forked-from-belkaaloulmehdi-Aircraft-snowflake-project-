# Aircraft Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze an aircraft database using SQL on Snowflake, a cloud data platform.  
The objective is to answer key business questions regarding flights, passenger traffic, and airline performance using SQL queries on a comprehensive dataset.

---

## 📜 Dataset & Context

The dataset is provided as a full SQL script that creates the database `AIRCRAFT_DB` with all necessary tables (`aircraft`, `airlines`, `airports`, `flight_summary_data`, `individual_flights`) and populates them with data.  
This project was completed as part of my Data Analyst training at Jedha Bootcamp.

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Number of flights per aircraft model.  
- Total passengers per airport.  
- Best year for RPM and ASM metrics per airline.  
- Top 5 airlines by RPM total.

## 🗂️ Results and Visual Proof  
- **CSV files** in `/results` contain raw exported query results for detailed analysis.  
- **Screenshots** in `/screenshots` display results directly from Snowflake for proof of execution.
